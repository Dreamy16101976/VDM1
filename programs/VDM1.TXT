The VDM1.DSK disk image contains a version of CP/M adapted
to utilize the CUTER-for-VDM1 monitor's output routines
for screen output. Input is read from port 1 of a 2-SIO card
at address 10h/11h. The CUTER-for-VDM1 monitor must be
present in RAM at C000h before booting the VDM1.DSK disk.
Note that the memory at C000h must be writable because CP/M
needs to slightly patch CUTER to use its output routines.

The CUTER-for-VDM1 monitor can be found here:
